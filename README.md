# DisableDevice
A utility for disabling a hardware device

Usage:
Originally dedesinged for disabling my Dell Touchpad programmatically. Choosing a hardware class type from the left column populates a list of hardware devices in the class on the right column. Clicking the Disable/Enable button will handle that action for the selected device. Additionally, hitting "F7" at any time while the program is running will toggle the selected device.

Next steps:
- Clean up the UI and make it pretty
- Add functionality for modifiers and other hotkeys
- Add functionality for adding/removing devices to a favorites screen and make that default
